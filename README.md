## About the Game

**Brackeys 2025 Theme:** *"Nothing can go wrong…"*

1. The player is an ordinary chef who, after using up his ingredients, decides to cross the street to restock at the supermarket.
2. What starts off as a simple errand turns increasingly bizarre and absurd – after falling into a construction hole, the chef finds himself in the eerie, inescapable **Backrooms** and then ventures through a world reminiscent of **Tetris** before eventually securing his ingredients.

Guide your character through a series of ever-changing worlds inspired by video games, movies, and stories to survive and ultimately achieve your mission!
